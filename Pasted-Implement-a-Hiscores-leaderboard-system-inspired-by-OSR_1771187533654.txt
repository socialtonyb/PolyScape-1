Implement a “Hiscores” leaderboard system inspired by OSRS.

1) Create a Hiscores page (/hiscores) with:
- Period toggle: Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly
- Metric toggle: GP Profit, Predictions Correct, Skill XP Gained (overall XP gained during selected period)
- A ranked table with columns: Rank, Username, Metric Value
- Search bar that lets users search usernames and navigate to their profile
- Pagination (25 rows per page)

2) Define metrics:
- GP Profit leaderboard = net trading GP gained in the selected period (sells + resolve payouts - buys). Exclude random event/achievement GP unless explicitly enabled by a config.
- Predictions Correct leaderboard = count of correct resolved markets in the selected period where the user had a meaningful stake AND was not hedged at resolve.
- Skill XP Gained leaderboard = total XP gained across all skills in the selected period.

3) Skills Hiscores (/hiscores/skills):
- No period toggle here.
- Tabs: Overall + individual skills.
- Overall table ranks users by Total Level (sum of skill levels) and shows Total XP.
- Individual skill pages show Username, Skill Level, Skill XP.
- Pagination and search.

4) User lookup profile (/hiscores/user/[username]):
Show:
- Total Level + Total XP
- Prediction accuracy (Correct/Total + percent)
- Lifetime GP trading profit (and optionally last 30 days)
Tabs:
- Skills: list all 8 skills with level + xp
- Recent Bets: last 5 bets with market, outcome, shares, GP spent/received, timestamp; “See more” shows full paginated history
- Current Positions: list open market positions with shares and net GP spent (“amount wagered”) per market

5) Data + performance:
- Create a per-user-per-market resolution summary row on market settlement to store:
  - correct boolean, hedged boolean, profitGp, resolvedAt
- Create per-user period aggregates for daily/weekly/monthly/yearly:
  - gpProfitTrading, predictionsCorrect, predictionsTotal, xpGainedTotal
- Update aggregates incrementally after trades and resolves (or via scheduled jobs).
- Add minimum meaningful stake rule to prevent farming: only count markets/trades above threshold for correctness and XP leaderboards.

6) OSRS-inspired UI styling:
- Parchment-like background, simple serif font, compact table, left-side navigation feel
- Keep it clean and readable; do not use copyrighted OSRS assets unless they are user-uploaded.
